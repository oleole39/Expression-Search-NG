    <h1>TB 115: Asking for Donations for the Update to TB SuperNova Version</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>There are very substantial code changes in TB 115. The main window has
      been converted from XUL to HTML, many elements are gone or have a
      different id, the 'QuickFilterBarMuxer' and the quickfilter-expando have
      been replaced, mail:3pane is now about:3pane, and .....&nbsp; many more
      changes.</p>
    <p>I have tested that the conversion for TB 115 is doable and that filters
      will run as before - I already tested for the fundamental functionality,
      such as <i>'s:subject f:fromsomewhere t:tosomeone'</i></p>
    <p><strong>In principle, that works in 115</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now it needs a lot of work to bring everything into the new layout.</p>
    <h2>Donations are very much welcome.</h2>
